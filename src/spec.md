# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current Hero “female flash card” image with a full-stack development themed image while keeping the existing light SaaS look and Hero layout/behavior unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Create an edited replacement for the current Hero right-side image using a full-stack development themed visual in the same illustration style.
- Update the Hero section image reference to use the new generated static asset, ensuring the existing rounded card, tilt/hover, and parallax behavior remain intact.

**User-visible outcome:** The Hero section shows a full-stack development related image instead of the “female flash card,” with the same layout and responsive rendering across mobile/tablet/desktop.
