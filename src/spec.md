# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the portfolio to a light, clean SaaS-style theme with a split hero layout, polished lightweight motion, and refreshed skills/projects presentation using icon and image cards.

**Planned changes:**
- Switch global styling from dark glassmorphism to a light SaaS-style palette (off-white/soft gray background), with soft shadows, rounded corners, layered sections, and subtle light glass-card surfaces.
- Update global tokens/base background treatment with subtle gradients/lighting and light-theme decorative accents that add depth without reducing readability.
- Redesign the Hero into a responsive split layout: left column headline exactly “Full-Stack Web & Application Developer”, 2–3 line intro, and social icons with hover animations; right column shows a profile image inside a rounded shadowed card with a subtle tilt/floating effect.
- Add motion polish: scroll-triggered fade/slide reveals for major sections, refined hover animations on buttons/cards, gentle parallax on at least one hero visual element, and subtle cursor-based micro-interactions; honor prefers-reduced-motion.
- Revise Skills into a grid of icon cards with subtle hover glow, preserving the exact skill list (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, AWS, Python AI/ML workflows).
- Revise Projects into image thumbnail cards with title, short description, smooth hover animations, and a “View on GitHub” link preserving existing repository URLs.
- Update Contact section styling to match the light theme with clean form UI and soft focus states, while preserving existing validation, submission behavior, success/error states, and visible social/profile links.
- Ensure responsiveness, performance, and SEO/metadata continuity after layout and styling changes.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a light, premium SaaS-style single-page portfolio with a new split hero, animated-but-light interactions (with reduced-motion support), and updated skills/projects sections featuring icon and image cards, while contact submissions and admin-protected listings continue to work.
