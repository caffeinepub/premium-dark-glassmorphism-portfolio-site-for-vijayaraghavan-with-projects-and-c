  "summary": "REQ-23 focuses on swapping out the existing “female flash card” hero image with a full‑stack themed static asset while keeping the Hero layout/styling intact and not changing copy/site structure. The diff shows modifications to HeroSection.tsx and metadata/state summary files, but does not show any new/updated image asset under frontend/public/assets/generated, and it appears to change Hero text/copy which is explicitly a non-goal.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added/removed files and does not show any modification/addition of the replacement image asset (e.g., profile-fullstack.dim_900x1100.png) under frontend/public/assets/generated. The only concrete code shown references background/accent images, not the profile image replacement.",

      "description": "Modified social icon implementation/imports (lucide-react icons vs react-icons) and potentially other Hero behavior unrelated to the requested image swap.",
