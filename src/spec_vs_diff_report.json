  "summary": "The diff updates the Hero section but appears to change the Hero layout/content beyond simply removing a flashcard image, potentially violating the constraint to keep the existing Hero split layout intact.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Keep the existing light SaaS-style theme and current Hero split layout intact.",
      "reason": "HeroSection.tsx now shows a centered, text-only hero content block (\"Centered Text Content\" / \"text-center\") and does not show the prior split layout structure; this suggests the Hero layout was changed rather than only removing the flashcard image.",

    {
      "description": "Added/introduced parallax and scroll-reveal behavior in the Hero via useParallax/useScrollReveal hooks.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to remove the flashcard image and explicitly listed non-goals around redesigning the Hero beyond that; adding animation/behavior hooks is an unrequested enhancement.",
